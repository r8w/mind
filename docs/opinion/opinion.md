## Introduction

In my opinion, I'm a highly opinionated person. I've got views on almost everything, which sometimes makes me an unreasonable person. I think your opinion doesn't make you an expert on any subject, but it does give you a sense of perspective through which you get to know more about it. To have an assertion, one must be aware of the subject, at least in a vague form.

This section's content will be heavily opinionated, and I'll give my mind complete independence for shitting on almost everything possible. I don't intend to hold myself back because if I don't take the garbage out, it will remain there and never let me proceed to understand the actuality and reason for my point of view.
