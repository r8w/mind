# Today's Fight

__*shouldn't have happened...*__

---

## Introduction

I can fight one person at a time. I do not like the idea of getting beat up, and I'm not interested in getting my ass kicked, so I pick fights with care. I'm adequate with verbal massacre because I can be loud and give hypothetical threats -- *I'll whoop your ass if you dare touch me.*

Now, let's be realistic for a moment. My whole life, I've avoided physical or verbal conflicts with people. I've had my fair share of kicking asses, but it makes me feel bad afterward. Fortunately, I haven't been thrashed out, which now acts as a layer of confidence over my ability to throw a few punches.

Life is long, and I understand I'll have to encounter moments where I'll unquestionably dominate or run away without shame. I don't mind any of it, but I'm not a wooer of guilt, so what I believe most reasonable for me is - *avoiding conflicts*. I'll stick to this path unless someone pulls me towards it for a fraction of the moment.

I'm not worried about the clashes in context to social media. During my Facebook days, I used to debate and fight with people in different groups because I thought it was the best way to convince people to believe in what I acknowledged, factual or sensible - *it didn't matter.*

The more you debate, the cockier you get because you pick your fights only in those areas where you think you've enough knowledge to make someone feel stupid. Without any realization, it becomes apparent for you to notice the minor details since your interest level is way too high and critical.

*__Why create a separate section?__*

Honestly, I would like to write about the events where I was full of rage, and I could feel my blood boiling and body shaking. Most of the time, when your encounter with something unpleasant is over, you're either filled with joy, excitement, disgust, or guilt. To me, conclusions and reasons are crucial. Otherwise, I'll think about things for eternity.
