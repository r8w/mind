# Today's Conversation

__*damn that's crazy!*__

---

## Introduction

I oftentimes wonder how many stories and thoughts go missing just because I didn't put them somewhere. During my entire course of life, I've had spontaneous conversations with random people, chitchats with absolutely unknown, and discussions with strangers. It doesn't happen often, but somehow I meet interesting people who have stories to tell.

I used to have a diary where I'd write these things, but god knows where it is. I'm sure I've lost it, but I don't throw my things away, so there exists a possibility. I also don't accept the fact I threw it away. At this point, it's just me being a hopeless romantic in a different context. I've moved on, and I do not miss the lost content, but I wish I still had them. Life â€” *is a pure form of contradiction, and I make it happen.*
