## Introduction

> *Okay, what about this show?*			<br>
> *I have not, unfortunately.*

The source of entertainment and entertainment itself in my life -- *it's limited*. It does not make me feel anything, and I feel fortunate when it's about maintaining distance with the fear of missing out. It does not matter to me. I remain unaffected by these stupid feelings. I enjoy what I enjoy, and I do not desire to be a part of something that's a hot topic as the hype swallows the best of what could have been entertaining and delightful. However, I'm aware of what I appreciate. I do not hate fun activities, but not everything is fun.

Again, the goal is not to be serious. Enjoy little things, and have fun.

*Remember,* don't be too serious, as, after all, entertainment and criticality don't compliment each other. If you're finding peace and pleasure in something, do it. Otherwise, *don't force yourself.*
