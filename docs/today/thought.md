# Today's Thought

__*that does not make sense. it probably does*__

## Introduction

Thoughts are opinions in disguise, but they're less biased. It's not an opinion but a thought. The undecided and unpredictable waves of words that had no basis or foundation till your consciousness put them in perspective through the lens of internal matter, and now you're aware of it.

__*It didn't make sense, right? But hopefully, it will, as it should.*__

Clarity of thought is an absolute necessity, but it's not required as most of them fade over time. The problem arrives without invitation when there's a constant internal suppression and external pretending about vital affairs, which certainly need to be addressed with care.
