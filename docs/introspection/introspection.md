## Introduction

There are a few areas of my mental state where I want to work. I do not plan to understand the complexity of bits and pieces and achieve enlightenment. For me, an attempt is necessary and a necessity through which I become competent so that I do not drown in the waves of emotions, and even if the day arrives, I better be prepared to swim across that ocean.

__The only goal of mine through this section is to -__

- *Write everything I feel and write without filters.*
- *Do not write about people and society. Period.*

Restrictions are helpful, they let you think inside the box, and sometimes it's okay to think inside the box. You don't know how big this box is. I'll walk a few miles before I start running.
